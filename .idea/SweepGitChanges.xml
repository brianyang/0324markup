        <option value="Fixes incorrect height of the scribble animation by standardizing the SVG and container dimensions to 72px and removing scaling transformations. The file `1-home-mid.html` was modified to adjust CSS styles and JavaScript logic for the animation container and SVG elements, ensuring consistent height, preventing overflow, and maintaining proper alignment and aspect ratio during hover animations." />
        <option value="Fix inconsistent scribble animation height by removing scaling and enforcing fixed dimensions. Updated `1-home-mid.html` to eliminate transform scaling on hover and animation containers, set a fixed height of 72px for `.scribble-svg` and its container, and adjusted `preserveAspectRatio` to `xMidYMid slice` to crop excess height. These changes ensure the animation matches the correct SVG height and prevents overflow." />
        <option value="Fix scribble animation height by removing scaling and enforcing consistent dimensions. Updated `1-home-mid.html` to eliminate transform scaling on hover and animation containers, set explicit height and max-height for the SVG to 72px, and adjusted `preserveAspectRatio` to `xMidYMid slice` to crop excess height. These changes ensure the animation renders at the correct height and aligns visually with the intended design." />
        <option value="Adjusted the scribble animation height to maintain a consistent 72px size by removing unnecessary scaling and repositioning the SVG. Modified `1-home-mid.html` to eliminate scale transforms on hover and animation elements, and explicitly set the SVG height and position within `#scribble-animation-container` to ensure the animation displays at the correct height without distortion." />
        <option value="Implemented Lottie-based scribble animation for the &quot;Contact Support&quot; button on the homepage. Updated `1-home-mid.html` to restructure the button layout, apply new styles for animation visibility and responsiveness, and initialize the Lottie animation with custom hover and reverse playback behavior. Modified `lottie-buttons.js` to enhance animation playback reliability, including deferred event listeners and safeguards to ensure animations complete properly." />
