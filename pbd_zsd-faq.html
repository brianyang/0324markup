                While the mechanism of action of cholic acid has not been fully established, it is known that cholic acid and its conjugates are endogenous ligands of the nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR regulates enzymes and transporters that are involved in bile acid synthesis and in the enterohepatic circulation to maintain bile acid homeostasis under normal physiologic conditions.<br><br>
                CHOLBAM may improve bile flow and increase solubilization of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins through emulsification.</p>

Patients with milder signs and symptoms may have a delay in diagnosis, as these signs and symptoms may not appear abnormal to parents. In addition, many other diseases present similarly.
